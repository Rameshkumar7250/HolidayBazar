        <h3>Jingle Holiday Bazar flights</h3>
        <h5>Why to book Flights Online with Jingle <br>
                 Holiday Bazar.com</h5>
        <p>
          Purchasing flight tickets and confirming your flight booking is the key 
          aspect of planning a trip. Now whether you are travelling for business or
          on leisure, you cannot make an itinerary until you have first and foremost
          booked your flights. Procuring an air ticket is a mandatory first step once
          your travel plans are confirmed. It feels as though half the job is done the
          moment you secure confirmed flight ticket booking in your hand. The entire
          activity of searching air connectivity between two cities, checking the
          schedule of the flight and zeroing in on one that's most convenient to you 
          can feel like a lot of work especially if you are in a hurry to book your flights.
